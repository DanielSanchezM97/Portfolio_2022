            Hello my name is <strong>Daniel Sanchez</strong> <br /> I was born
            and raised in Costa Rica but moved to California when I turned 19
            with my family. I am very passionate about art, dance and sports, I
            also love to spend time with my family and I love modeling. I
            started my modeling career at the age of 21 and since then I have
            been attracted to how you can express the beauty and artistry of a
            woman through modeling. Currently I have dedicated myself to travel
            with my husband and at the same time work in what I am passionate
            about knowing the beauty of each country and its beautiful people.
