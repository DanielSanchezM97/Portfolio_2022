            Hello my name is <strong>Daniel Sanchez</strong> <br /> I was born
            and raised in Costa Rica. At the age of 21 web design caught my
            attention and at that moment I knew I wanted to dedicate myself to
            this. I am passionate about web design, music and sports, I also
            like to spend time with my family and to be able to enjoy the
            outdoors. I started my web design career when I was 22 years old and
            since then I am attracted to how beauty and art can be expressed
            through web design, turning the user experience into a new and
            satisfying experience with each design like the one I feel when I
            see the amazing designs that leave you speechless. I am an
            analytical, responsible person and a good problem solver. Currently
            I have dedicated myself to learn new technologies and I am always
            looking for new challenges to improve my skills.
